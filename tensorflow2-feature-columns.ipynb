    "# tensorflow 2 feature columns and keras\n",
    "\n",
    "[tensorflow 2.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/effective_tf2) was just recently introduced and one of the most anticipated features, in my opininion, was the revamping its feature columns. [Last July](https://dantegates.github.io/2018/07/17/keras-feature-columns.html) I published a blog post which was enthusiastic about the idea of `tensorflow's` [feature columns](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/feature_columns) but disappointed by the actual implementation. Mainly because they weren't compatible with `keras` even though `tensorflow` had already adopted the `keras` API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately the implementation I posted about last July is, well, so last year, and `tensorflow 2.0` introduces some considerable improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post we'll demonstrate how to use the new feature columns with `keras` Sequential and functional APIs."

    "# Feature Columns and the Sequential API\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with tensorflow feature columns and the Sequential API is pretty straightforward. [The official documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/feature_columns) contains some easy to follow examples. Below we'll basically recreate an example from the documentation, however we will demonstrate how to work the example with `pandas` instead of `tensorflow` `DataSet`s.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic workflow is simple\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a feature column for each feature you want to train on.\n",
    "- Use `keras.layers.DenseFeatures` to wrap the feature columns together.\n",
    "- Include the `DenseFeatures` object as the first layer in the Sequential model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In code this amounts to\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import tensorflow.feature_columns as fc\n",
    "\n",
    "feature_price = fc.numeric_column('price'),  # same name as column in `df`\n",
    "feature_product = fc.embedding_column(\n",
    "    fc.categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list(\n",
    "        'product_id', df.product_id.unique()\n",
    "    )\n",
    ")\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "feature_layer = tf.keras.layers.DenseFeatures([feature_price, feature_product])\n",
    "model = tf.keras.Sequential([\n",
    "    feature_layer,\n",
    "    Dense(32, activation='relu'),\n",
    "    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')\n",
    "])\n",
    "model.compile(...)\n",
    "\n",
    "# use `pandas.DataFrame.to_dict('series')` to get a dictionary of feature names\n",
    "# to values as input to training and predicting.\n",
    "model.fit(df.to_dict('series'), ...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, handling categorical columns can be a little awkward. It takes *at least* two function calls and five underscores to create an embedding column. `tensorflow` has never been afraid of verbosity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another implementation detail worth pointing out is that `DenseFeatures` layers won't infer shapes until they have a) been called with a `keras` `Input` layer or actual data (i.e. at `model.fit`). This means that in the example above `model.summary()` would raise an `Exception` if called before `model.fit()` (because the layer has not been built yet). This will come up again when we look at the functional API but it's probably worth noting now since it's likely suprising behavior for users who are familiar with the standard `keras` implementation."

    "Unlike [my earlier post](https://dantegates.github.io/2018/07/17/keras-feature-columns.html) on `tensorflow` feature columns I'm more optimistic about the current implementation. `tensorflow2` contains substantial improvements over the version 1 implementation, mainly, in my opinion, plug-and-playability with `keras`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of the time of this writing (Oct. 24, 2019) here's the full list of pros and cons as I see them\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**\n",
    "1. Plug and play with `keras`.\n",
    "2. Works nicely with data-frame like data sets, such as `pandas`.\n",
    "3. Couples feature transformations with the model object, eliminating the need for multiple objects or pipelines at runtime (e.g. a Transformer and Predictor).\n",
    "4. Supports a broad range of typical categorical feature transformations.\n",
    "5. Removes some boiler plate code - no need to concatenate multiple embedding layers for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**\n",
    "1. Can't access learned embeddings, one-hot-encodings, etc. (at least if you can it's not well documented yet).\n",
    "2. `len('categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list'.split('_')) == 5`\n",
    "3. The documentation seems to still be a work in progress. For example, official feature columns are [documented](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/feature_column/sequence_categorical_column_with_hash_bucket) but are only compatible with [experimental features](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/experimental/SequenceFeatures).\n",
    "4. Sequential feature columns are not yet supported, although they look like they are under development.\n",
    "5. Leaves some boiler plate that could likely be refactored out. For example\n",
    "\n",
    "    - It's not hard to imagine the two function calls to create a one-hot encoding feature column being only one call.\n",
    "    - Or, perhaps, a single function call could create an create `Input` and `Embedding` layer and return the corresponding tensor connecting the two. This suggestion may have its own drawbacks, and perhaps this is why feature columns were not implemented this way, but it could offer an even more user friendly interface - especially since we currently have to specify the shape and data type when creating the `Input` layers."
